AdventureKid's (AKWF project) single cycle waveforms are great because they cover almost
  the entire range for this synthesis method.
 	
I noticed a long time ago that they all have some kind of common sound, something like
  a bit of mushiness from excess limiting plus some noise-like pattern.

Recently, I thought about it and finally found a way to remove this mushy-like common sound:
  Audacity denoiser plugin, used almost like it is designed for!
  (That is, removing any recurent pattern in a sound recording, eg: static, distortion, eq... :)
  Given that 600 samples is an exact recurence in itself, "denoising" tends to be ideal!
  (Worst case, any common tone between the files would defeat the purpose of tone choice)
